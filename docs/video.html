<title>Video/Display Device Interface</title>
<h1>Video/Display Device Interface</h1>
<p>
The Glidix video interface is completely different from the primitive <i>X Window System</i> that most POSIX systems use. The interface allows graphics devices to be programmed, and establishes an interface between a window manager and GUI applications.
</p>

<h2>Video Device Files</h2>
<p>
Video Device Files create the interface between a graphics driver and userspace. There is no specific naming convention for such files, but they must be under <code>/dev</code>, and some standard commands must be supported. To open such a file, you must be <code>root</code> (UID 0), and they must be opened in read-write mode. After being opened by a privileged process, they may be passed via fork/exec to the window manager, which may be running in lower privileges. Everything needed to control those files is declared in <i>&lt;glidix/video.h&gt;</i>. There are 4 basic IOCTLs:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IOCTL_VIDEO_DEVSTAT</code> returns information about a device into a <code>KDisplayDeviceStat</code> structure.</li>
<li><code>IOCTL_VIDEO_MODSTAT</code> probes mode information; it takes a <code>KDisplayMode</code> structure, with its <code>index</code> field set to a value, and sets all other fields according to the mode.</li>
<li><code>IOCTL_VIDEO_SETMODE</code> takes a <code>KDisplayMode</code> structure and actually sets the requested video mode.</li>
<li><code>IOCTL_VIDEO_POST</code> takes no arguments and posts the contents of the back buffer onto the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a mode has been set, the <code>KDisplayMode</code> structure specifies the format and size of the back buffer. You can then call <i>mmap()</i> to map the back buffer into memory and draw into it. When finished drawing, just send the <code>IOCTL_VIDEO_POST</code> command to swap buffers.
