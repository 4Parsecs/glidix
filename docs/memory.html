<title>Glidix Memory Map</title>
<h1>Glidix Memory Map</h1>

<p>
Glidix uses 4KB pages. Using the PML4, the 48-bit virtual address space is divided into 512GB blocks, each with a different purpose. Here is the specific memory map:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pml4[0]</code> (except the first page) is for userspace processes.</li>
<li><code>pml4[1]</code> is used as a buffer when data is transferred between 2 userspace blocks.</li>
<li><code>pml4[256]</code> is the static kernel image (code, data, bss, symbols, etc).</li>
<li><code>pml4[257]</code> is the Interprocess Streaming Page (ISP), this is a single page that gets remapped to different addresses to send data to different address spaces etc. There may be more things in this PML4e in the future.</li>
<li><code>pml4[258]</code> is the kernel heap.</li>
<li><code>pml4[259]</code> is module space; each module is assigned a 1GB block within this PML4e, which limits the number of modules to 512.</li>
<li><code>pml4[260]</code> is used for the copy-on-write cache.</li>
<li><code>pml4[261]</code> is used for the per-CPU variable area (starts at <code>0xFFFF828000000000</code>).</li>
<li><code>pml4[262]</code> is used by the Low-level Graphics Interface (LGI) for memory-mapped framebuffers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The rest of the address space is reserved.
