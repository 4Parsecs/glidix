<title>The 'init' Process</title>
<h1>The <code>init</code> Process</h1>
<p>
In Glidix, the <code>init</code> process is always assigned the pid 1, and is started from the executable file <code>/initrd/init</code>. Its job is to start up the rest of the system, manage services while it runs, and then safely shut it down when signalled to do so. This process is therefore essential to the workings of the system, and is specifically protected by the kernel (e.g. you cannot send the <code>SIGKILL</code> signal to it).
</p>

<h2>Startup</h2>
<p>
The reason <code>init</code> is on the initial ramdisk (<code>initrd</code>) is because it is the first thing that runs, even before any drivers are loaded. When it is started, it begins the <i>startup stage</i>. The procedure is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It tries to load every module from the <code>/initrd/initmod</code> directory. This directory is expected to contain all drivers required for the next stages of startup.</li>
<li>It reads the startup configuration file <code>/initrd/startup.conf</code> (if it fails to boot with this configuration, it tries <code>/initrd/startup-fallback.conf</code>, and if that doesn't work, it simply hangs).</li>
<li>Using the configuration file, it finds out which device is the root filesystem, and using the previously-loaded drivers, mounts that filesystem at <code>/</code>.</li>
<li>At this point, the system is in <i>System State 0</i>.</li>
<li>The configuration files in <code>/etc/services</code> are parsed at this point, but no service is actually started.</li>
<li><code>init</code> then runs the application specified in the startup configuration, along with any given arguments. This usually starts the shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>) and runs the script <code>/etc/init/startup.sh</code>.</li>
<li>The startup script then mounts all filesystems by running <code>mount -a</code> (which mounts according to the configuration file <code>/etc/fstab</code>).</li>
<li>After this, it brings the system into <i>System State 1</i> (and all services appropriate for this state are started).</li>
<li>Standard initialization steps follow: this includes loading network configuration etc.</li>
<li>After this standard initialization, the system is brought into <i>System State 2</i> (and of course all appropriate services are started).</li>
<li>Now the system goes into a constant loop running <code>login</code> (until it is shut down).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Normal Operation</h2>
<p>
During normal system operation, the <code>init</code> process accepts commands on the message queue <code>/init-control</code> and forwards the <code>SIGINT</code> signal to its immediate child (the startup script), which typically ends up forwarding it to the user's shell, as appropriate. The reception of <code>SIGTERM</code> (typically sent by <code>poweroff</code>, <code>reboot</code> or <code>halt</code>) causes shutdown.
</p>

<h2>Shutdown</h2>
<p>
The following actions occur during a shutdown:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>/etc/init/shutdown.sh</code> script is ran, if it exists. Currently it usually does not.</li>
<li>The action name (<code>poweroff</code>, <code>reboot</code> or <code>halt</code>) is written to <code>/etc/down-action</code> for <code>init</code> to later read.</li>
<li>All services are stopped, dropping the system into lower and lower system states, until <i>System State 0</i> is reached.</li>
<li>The <code>/etc/down-action</code> file is now read, and the <code>_glidix_down()</code> system call is called with the appropriate action (if the file cannot be read, a <code>HALT</code> is the default).</li>
<li>The kernel then sends <code>SIGTERM</code> to all processes except <code>init</code>, and waits for them to terminate. At this point, calling <code>fork()</code>, <code>exec*()</code>, and some other functions is impossible.</li>
<li>After 10 seconds, if some processes are still running, they are killed immediately with <code>SIGKILL</code>.</li>
<li><code>init</code> itself is then killed, releasing all its resources such as open files.</li>
<li>All filesystems are unmounted.</li>
<li>All modules are unloaded.</li>
<li>After this, an ACPI shutdown, a reboot or a system halt (with a <code>panic()</code>) occurs. The system is now down.</li>
</ol>
