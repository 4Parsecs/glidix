<title>Glidix Module Interface</title>

<h1>Glidix Module Interface</h1>
<p>
The <i>Glidix Module Interface</i> (<i>GMI</i>) allows extra <i>modules</i> to be linked into the running Glidix kernel dynamically. Each module is stored in a <code>.gkm</code> file, which is just a relocatable ELF64 object file, which contains a <code>.modbody</code> section that needs to be loaded into memory, as well as its relocation table and the symbol table.
</p>

<h2>How modules are loaded</h2>
<p>
The Glidix kernel exposes a system call called <code>_glidix_insmod()</code>, which is responsible for loading modules. Its prototype is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
int _glidix_insmod(const char *<i>modname</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, const char *<i>opt</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre>

<p>
It takes the name of a module, which is later used to refer to it, and a path to a <code>.gkm</code> file to load the module from. You may also pass additional options to the module using the <i>opt</i> argument. We won't look at the flags here. The kernel reads the file specified by <i>path</i>, performs the neccessary relocations, and initializes the module.

<h2>How to build a module</h2>
<p>
The source code of a module is a bunch of <code>.c</code> files in a source directory; to build it, run the following command inside the source directory:
</p>

<pre>
modmake --modname=<i>name</i> [--sysroot=<i>sysroot</i>] [--host=x86_64-glidix]
</pre>

The <i>name</i> is a value used to decide the filename and module name of the module; the filename will be <code>out/<i>name</i>.gkm</code> and the module name should be <code>mod_<i>name</i></code> when it is loaded.
