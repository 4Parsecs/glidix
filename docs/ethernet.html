<title>Ethernet</title>
<h1>Ethernet</h1>

<p>
Ethernet is a specific type of network implemented in Glidix. This article explains how to write Ethernet drivers. All Ethernet-related stuff is defined in <code>&lt;glidix/ethernet.h&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h2>Receiving Packets</h2>
<p>
When an Ethernet packet is received, an Ethernet II frame should be passed to Glidix by calling <code>onEtherFrame()</code> (please note that it is not interrupt-safe; you should store the frame in an internal buffer first if it is received by an asynchronous interrupt). It si declared as follows:
</p>

<pre>
void onEtherFrame(NetIf <i>*netif</i>, const void <i>*frame</i>, size_t <i>size</i>);
</pre>

<p>
Where <i>netif</i> is the network interface that received the frame (the type must be <code>IF_ETHERNET</code>!), <i>frame</i> points to the start of the frame, and <i>size</i> is its total size in bytes. The function then unwraps whatever payload is contained in the frame and calls <code>onPacket()</code> or adds an ARP resolution to the device's cache.
</p>

<h2>Interface Definition and Sending Packets</h2>
<p>
When calling <code>CreateNetworkInterface()</code> for an Ethernet device, you must fill in the <code>ethernet</code> strucutre in the <code>NetIfConfig</code> union. The fields are as follows:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1cm;">
	<code>ifconfig.ethernet.type</code>
	<div style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">
		Must be set to <code>IF_ETHERNET</code>.
	</div>
	
	<code>ifconfig.ethernet.mac</code>
	<div style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">
		The MAC address of the device.
	</div>
	
	<code>void ifconfig.ethernet.send(NetIf <i>*netif</i>, const void <i>*frame</i>, size_t <i>size</i>)</code>
	<div style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">
		Points to a function responsible for sending Ethernet packets. <i>netif</i> is the interface we are sending from (guaranteed to be one of the devices you have registered yourself), <i>frame</i> points to an Ethernet II frame, and <i>size</i> is its total size in bytes.
	</div>
</div>

<p>
The rest of the structure must be filled with zeroes (e.g. using <code>memset()</code>)!.
</p>

<h2>Working of <code>sendPacket()</code> on Ethernet Devices</h2>
<p>
Once <code>sendPacket()</code> appropriately processes a packet (fragmentation, IP header attachment, etc), it passes all fragments with appropriate IP headers to <code>sendPacketToInterface()</code> which, in turn, for Ethernet devices, calls <code>sendPacketToEthernet()</code>. This function is given the gateway IP address, and so it attempts to transmit the packet as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It looks at the MAC resolution cache of the device, attempting to find the MAC addressfor the given IP.</li>
<li>If there was no resolution in the cache, it sends an ARP or NDP request for that MAC address, waiting up to 1 second for the response to arrive (currently, no packets can be sent during this time due to locks; we should look at this in the future).</li>
<li>Once the destination MAC is known, the IP packet is wrapped into an Ethernet frame and passed to the device.</li>
</ol>
