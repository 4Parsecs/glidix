<h1>Glidix Kernel Memory Allocator</h1>
<p>
Most of Glidix's kernel memory allocations are taken from the <i>kernel heap</i>. The basic idea is that you call <i>kmalloc()</i> when you need some memory, and <i>kfree()</i> (with a pointer to your previously-obtained memory) when you no longer need it. This is analogous to the userspace <i>malloc()</i> and <i>free()</i> functions. Space allocated on the heap is accessible, with no address translation necessary, to <b>all</b> kernel threads (regardless of address space), and is thus considered part of <i>kernel-global memory</i>. The heap is a special data strucutre: a set of variable-sized consecutive blocks of memory, along with headers and footers, where each block can be marked <b>USED</b> or <b>FREE</b>. The header of the very first block starts at the virtual memory address <code>0xFFFF810000000000</code>. We can describe this structure with the following table (where the top means the lowest memory address):
</p>

<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" border="1">
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77;"><td>Header 1<br>Free, size=4KB</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77; height: 100px;"><td>Data 1</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77;"><td>Footer 1<br>Size=4KB</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #FF7777;"><td>Header 2<br>Used, size=1KB</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #FF7777; height: 25px;"><td>Data 2</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #FF7777;"><td>Footer 2<br>Size=1KB</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77;"><td>Header 3<br>Free, size=2KB</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77; height: 50px;"><td>Data 3</td></tr>
<tr style="width: 100%; background-color: #77FF77;"><td>Footer 3<br>Size=2KB</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Since both the header and the footer contain the block size, it is possible to find a header corresponding to a footer and vice versa. This allows the kernel to walk the heap in both directions. There are also never 2 consecutive free blocks: <i>kfree()</i> automatically merges a block you are trying to freewith any consecutive free blocks to make a larger free block - this reduces <i>heap fragmentation</i>, making it more likely that somewhere on the heap there will be a block large enough to handle a request. Furthermore, when you call <i>kmalloc()</i> and the kernel finds a block that is way larger than you wanted, it will split it into 2: one block that is as small as possible but still a multiple of 16 bytes (more on this below), and the other block from the remainder of the original. That remainder is then marked "free" while your almost-perfect block is marked "used" and returned to you.
</p>

<p>
Upon boot-up, the heap starts as a single, free, 2MB block. When this block runs out and <i>kmalloc()</i> cannot complete a request, it <i>expands</i> the heap, adding another 2MB to it: if the last block is free, it is extended to accomodate the newly-allocated memory pages. If the last block is used, then a new free block is simply added to the end.
</p>

<p>
All structures on the heap are multiples of 16 bytes. If you request memory with <i>kmalloc()</i> with a size that is not a multiple of 16, it will be rounded up to a multiple of 16. This guarantess that all blocks returned by <i>kmalloc()</i> are aligned on a 16-byte boundary, which is the maximum alignment necessary on the x86-64. This ensures that structures that you allocate on the heap can guarantee alignment of their members, which boosts performance and is also necessary for stuff like SSE2.
