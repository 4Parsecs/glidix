<title>Glidix Network Interface</title>
<h1>Glidix Network Interfaces</h1>

<p>
A <i>network interface</i> is what connects network nodes together. An interface on one system is connected by some kind of link to an interface on another system (or the same system in some cases). Network Interface Card (NIC) drivers must create network interfaces representing the NICs to allow Glidix to send/receive packets over the network. This page explains the details behind how this system works. All relevant functions, macros etc are declared in <code>&lt;glidix/netif.h&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h2>Receiving Packets</h2>
<p>
When an interface receives a packet from the outside, it must first put it in an internal queue, then a "receive thread" must call <code>onPacket()</code> (as it is not interrupt-safe!). It is declared as follows:
</p>

<pre>
void onPacket(NetIf <i>*netif</i>, const void <i>*packet</i>, size_t <i>packetlen</i>);
</pre>

<p>
The <i>netif</i> is the network interface that received this packet, <i>packet</i> points to the packet data, and <i>packetlen</i> is its size. The packet must be an Internet-layer packet (so <i>packet</i> must point to the start of an IPv4 or IPv6 header). The driver <i>must not</i> validate the packet in any way - it must be passed to <code>onPacket()</code> even if it's not even an IPv4 or IPv6 - the kernel is responsible for the validation!
</p>

<h2>Sending a Packet</h2>
<p>
The general function for sending a packet is <code>sendPacket()</code>. It is declared as follows:
</p>

<pre>
int sendPacket(struct sockaddr <i>*src</i>, const struct sockaddr <i>*dest</i>, const void <i>*packet</i>, size_t <i>packetlen</i>, int <i>flags</i>, uint64_t <i>nanotimeout</i>, const char <i>*ifname</i>);
</pre>

<p>
<i>src</i> and <i>dest</i> are the source and destination addresses, respectively. The addresses must be in the same domain (either <code>AF_INET</code> or <code>AF_INET6</code>), unless <i>src</i> has the family <code>AF_UNSPEC</code> - in this case, the <i>src</i> structure shall be filled with the address to be used as the source in subsequent transmissions to the given destination (the <i>default address</i> of the route), and that default address is also used for the current transmission. <i>packetlen</i> is the size of the packet and <i>packet</i> points to the start of it.  If the <code>PKT_HDRINC</code> flag is passed, <i>packet</i> shall point to an IPv4 or IPv6 header; otherwise, the appropriate header is automatically attached. <i>flags</i> specify additional "yes or no" options for the transmission. <i>nanotimeout</i> is the maximum amount of time, in nanoseconds, that you're willing to wait for the transmission before you consider it as failed. If <i>ifname</i> is <code>NULL</code>, the packet is sent through whatever interface has the route to the destination - otherwise, it is restricted to the interface named <i>ifname</i>. If <code>PKT_HDRINC</code> is not passed, then the bottom 8 bits of <i>flags</i> is the next-layer protocol number to put in the IP header (one of the <code>IPPROTO_*</code> macros). The function returns 0 on success, or an error number (<code>&lt;glidix/errno.h&gt;</code>) with a flipped sign (e.g. <code>-ENETUNREACH</code>) on error. The possible flags are as follows:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Flag</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>PKT_HDRINC</code></td><td>If set, the IP header is already included in the packet; otherwise, this function will automatically append it. If you specify this option, then the packet will still be sent to <i>dest</i> even if the IP packet indicates a different destination (hence <i>dest</i> specifies the gateway address).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>PKT_DONTROUTE</code></td><td>If set, the packet will only be sent through direct routes (without gateways).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>PKT_DONTFRAG</code></td><td>If set, the packet must not be fragmented (if the packet cannot pass an interface, <code>-E2BIG</code> is returned). This is implied if <code>PKT_HDRINC</code> was passed.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
If the protocol is <code>IPPROTO_RAW</code>, then <code>PKT_HDRINC</code> and <code>PKT_DONTFRAG</code> are implied.
</p>

<p>
The function may block up to <i>nanotimeout</i> nanoseconds if the physical address of the destination or gateway is unknown, or the path MTU is unknown, and a detection is necessary (via ARP/NDP for physical address, or PMTUD for the path MTU).
</p>

<p>
If either address is an IPv6 address in the <code>::ffff:0:0/96</code> network, the other address must also be an IPv6 address in that network. In this case they are treated as IPv4 addresses mapped into the IPv6 address space, and so they are converted to a <code>struct sockaddr_in</code>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>nanotimeout</i> of 0 indicates indefinite wait.
</p>

<p>
Example of sending an ICMP Echo packet with indefinite timeout:
</p>

<pre>
int status = sendPacket(&src_addr, &dest_addr, &ping_packet, sizeof(PingPacket), IPPROTO_ICMP | PKT_DONTFRAG, 0, NULL);
if (status != 0)
{
	kprintf("the send failed!\n");
	// ...
};
</pre>

<h2>ICMP Error Messages</h2>
<p>
To send ICMP error messages easily, you can use macros and functions from <code>&lt;glidix/icmp.h&gt;</code>. It declares a general function for sending ICMP error messages:
</p>

<pre>
int sendErrorPacket(struct sockaddr <i>*src</i>, const struct sockaddr <i>*dest</i>, int <i>errnum</i>, const void <i>*packet</i>, size_t <i>packetlen</i>);
</pre>

<p>
<i>src</i> and <i>dest</i> are the source and destination addresses for the ICMP packet; they are treated as in <code>sendPacket()</code>. <i>errnum</i> is an error number (from &lt;glidix/errno.h&gt;) which is then mapped onto the appropriate ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 type and code. <i>packet</i> points to the IP header of the packet that caused the error, and <i>packetlen</i> is the size of that packet. Return values are the same as for <code>sendPacket()</code>. The flags passed to <code>sendPacket()</code> are: <code>IPPROTO_ICMP | PKT_DONTFRAG</code>.
</p>

<p>
There is also a function for decoding ICMP error packets:
</p>
