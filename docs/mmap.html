<title>Glidix Memory Mapping</title>
<h1>Glidix Memory Mapping</h1>

<p>
All virtual memory available to a Glidix process is said to be <i>mapped</i> into its address space. Hence, the address space is a list of <i>mappings</i>, each with different <i>permissions</i>, <i>locations</i> and <i>types</i>. Under Glidix, the following types of mappings exist:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Anonymous mapping</i> - memory used privately by a single process, backed by physical memory but no filesystem objects. When first accessing a page of an anonymous mapping, the page is filled with zeroes by the system.</li>
<li><i>Device memory mapping</i> - a mapping of memory backed on a separate device (not RAM). For example, this may refer to a graphics card's video memory.</li>
<li><i>Private file mapping</i> - backed by physical memory, initialized with data from a file. The kernel attempts to minimize the number of duplications of a file's data in memory. When first accessing a page from such a mapping, it is filled with the file data. Modifying the data does <i>not</i> write it back to the file.</li>
</ul>
