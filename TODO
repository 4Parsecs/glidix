 * Make sure that dup() in filesystem drivers actually causes both descriptions to point to the same offset.
 * When ne2k.c returns MODINIT_CANCEL, it corrupts the heap and the "strings" block allocated by module.c gets a
   broken footer. Should look into how the module unloading happens. For now, insmod() does not unload cancelled
   modules.
