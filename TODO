 * When ne2k.c returns MODINIT_CANCEL, it corrupts the heap and the "strings" block allocated by module.c gets a
   broken footer. Should look into how the module unloading happens. For now, insmod() does not unload cancelled
   modules.
 * Handle all CPU exceptions such as #GP.
 * BSS in modules doesn't get zeroed?
 * set the WP bit!!!! Otherwise the kernel overwrites temporarily-shared copy-on-write pages.
