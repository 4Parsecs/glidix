 * When ne2k.c returns MODINIT_CANCEL, it corrupts the heap and the "strings" block allocated by module.c gets a
   broken footer. Should look into how the module unloading happens. For now, insmod() does not unload cancelled
   modules.
 * Handle all CPU exceptions such as #GP.
 * BSS in modules doesn't get zeroed?
 * Thread-temporary mappings (MAP_THREAD); and make sure that thread stacks are allocated using this method.
 * Usersapce heap (in libc) should unify blocks.
