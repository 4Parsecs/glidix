_glidix_fsinfo - get information about filesystems

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/fsinfo.h>
	
	size_t _glidix_fsinfo(struct fsinfo *'list', size_t 'count');

>DESCRIPTION

This function stores information about mounted fileystems in the 'list', which is an array of 'count' elements of type 'struct fsinfo', which is a structure defined in '<sys/fsinfo.h>' and includes the following fields:

	struct fsinfo
	{
		dev_t					'fs_dev';
		char*					'fs_image';
		char*					'fs_mntpoint';
		char*					'fs_name';
		size_t					'fs_usedino';
		size_t					'fs_inodes';
		size_t					'fs_usedblk';
		size_t					'fs_blocks';
		size_t					'fs_blksize';
	};

The 'fs_dev' field is a unique identifier of the filesystem; this is the value placed in the 'st_dev' field by [stat.2] on files on this filesystem. The 'fs_image' field is the filesystem image, usually the name of the file or device that contains it (e.g. '/dev/sda0'). The 'fs_mntpoint' field specifies the mountpoint, with a slash at the end (e.g. '/dev/'), and 'fs_name' is the name of the filesystem (e.g. 'gxfs').

The 'fs_usedino' and 'fs_inodes' field specify the number of used inodes, and the total number of inodes available, respectively. If the latter is 0, it means there is no inode information available for this filesystem. Likewise, 'fs_usedblk' and 'fs_blocks' specify the number of used, and total blocks. The 'fs_blksize' field specifies the size, in bytes, of a block.

>RETURN VALUE

On success, this function returns the number of entries in 'list' that were filled in. Otherwise, it returns 0 (no entries filled in), and sets 'errno' to indicate the error.

>ERRORS

This function may set 'errno' to one of the following value:

\* *EFAULT* - 'list' is an invalid pointer.
