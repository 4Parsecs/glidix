>NAME

close - close a file

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <unistd.h>
	
	int close(int 'fd');

>DESCRIPTION

This function closes a file previously opened by [open.2] or a similar function. The argument 'fd' is the file descriptor to be closed. Attempting to pass a value of 'fd' which was not previously returned by [open.2] or a related function, or which was already passed to [close.2] before being reused by [open.2] or a related function, results in undefined bahavior.

>RETURN VALUE

Under Glidix, this function always returns 0.

>ERRORS

This function reports no errors, but passing an invalid value in 'fd' causes undefined behavior.
