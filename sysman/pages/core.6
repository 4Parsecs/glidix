>NAME

core - Core dump

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <glidix/core.h>

>DESCRIPTION

To allow a broken application to be debugged after a crash, Glidix provides support for core dumps. When a signal is received, whose disposition (see [sigaction.2]) is set to *SIG_CORE*, the program is terminated, and a file named 'core' is produced in the current working directory. The core file currently contains the following information:

\* The credentials of the process which crashed. See [creds.6].
\* Information about the signal which caused the crash. See [signal.6].
\* A full dump of the process\' address space.
\* A list of threads which were running at the time of the crash, and their complete state.

Core dumps may be inspected by a debugger to get information such as a stack trace, list of loaded libraries, etc.
