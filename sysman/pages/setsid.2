>NAME

setsid - start a new session

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	
	pid_t setsid();

>DESCRIPTION

This function starts a new session. The calling process must not be a process group leader. After this function is called, and is successful, the session ID becomes equal to the PID, making the calling process the leader of a new session; the process group ID is also set to the PID, creating a new process group in which the calling process is the leader. This disconnects the calling process from its controlling terminal, and you should call [close.2] on any terminal handles (usually standard input/output/error).

>RETURN VALUE

On success, this function returns the new session ID, which is equal to the PID as returned by [getpid.2]. On error, it returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following values:

\* *EPERM* - the calling process is the process group leader.
