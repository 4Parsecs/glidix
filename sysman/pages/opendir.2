>NAME

opendir - open a directory reader

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <dirent.h>
	
	DIR* opendir(const char *'dirname');

>DESCRIPTION

This function opens a directory reader on the directory named by 'dirname'. The directory reader can then be passed to [readdir.2] to read directory contents, and finally to [closedir.2] to close the reader.

>RETURN VALUE

On success, this function returns a pointer to an opaque structure 'DIR', representing the directory reader. On error, it returns *NULL* and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns *NULL* and sets [errno.6] to one of the following:

\* *ENOENT* - 'dirname' does not exist.

\* *EACCES* - permission was denied to access 'dirname' or one of its parent directories.

\* *EIO* - error trying to access the underlying filesystem.

\* *ELOOP* - a loop in symbolic links was detected.

\* *ENOTDIR* - 'dirname', or one of its parent directories, is not really a directory.
