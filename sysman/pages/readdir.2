>NAME

readdir - get next directory entry

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <dirent.h>
	
	struct dirent* readdir(DIR *'dirp');

>DESCRIPTION

This function returns the next directory entry in the directory referred to be the directory reader 'dirp'. The reader is created by calling [opendir.2] on the desired directory. Each call to 'readdir()' returns one entry, and when all entries have been read, *NULL* is returned.

The pointer returned by 'readdir()' is stored within the 'DIR' structure; hence, it is only valid until a subsequent call to 'readdir()' or to [closedir.2].

The strucutre 'struct dirent' is defined in '<dirent.h>' and includes the following fields:

	struct dirent
	{
		ino_t			'd_ino';
		char*			'd_name';
	};

The 'd_ino' field is the entry\'s inode number (a unique identifier assigned to each object in a filesystem), and 'd_name' contains the name of the entry.

All directories contain 2 special entries: '.' which refers to the directry itself, and '..' which refers to its parent directory.

>RETURN VALUE

This function returns a pointer to a 'struct dirent' describing the directory entry that was just fetched, or *NULL* if no more entries are present.
