>NAME

daemon - start a process in the background

>SYNOPSIS

	daemon [-p 'pidfile'] [-i 'infile'] [-o 'logfile'] 'executable' ['args']...

>DESCRIPTION

This commands runs 'executable' in the background, passing it the appropriate arguments ('args') and exits. The executable continues to run in the background, while you can run other commands. The new process cannot access the terminal, as processes running in the background are disconnected from any terminal. By default, all standard streams are connected to '/dev/null' and so no input or output is possible. If the *-i* option is passed, then 'infile' specified a file to be connected to standard input. Likewise, if *-o* is passed, then 'logfile' specifies a file which standard output and error are connected to.

If the *-p* option is passed, then 'pidfile' specifies a special file, which the daemon will attempt to lock, and will then write the new process\' PID to on the first line (while keeping any possible garbage on further lines). If the locking fails, the daemon doesn\'t run. This is used to ensure that only one copy of a certain task is running on the system at any one time.
