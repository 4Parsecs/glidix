>NAME

ps - show process list

>SYNOPSIS

	ps [-a]

>DESCRIPTION

This command shows the list of currently running processes. It shows the PID, real user, real group, CPU usage and command-line of each process. By default, it shows only processes ran by the current user; if the *-a* switch is passed, it shows all processes on the system. However, in order to see all processes, it must be invoked as the root user, e.g. using [sudo.1].
