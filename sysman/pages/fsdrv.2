>NAME

fsdrv - get a list of filesystem drivers

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/call.h>
	
	int 'count' = (int) __syscall(__SYS_fsdrv, char *'buffer', int 'maxcount');

>DESCRIPTION

This function loads a list of filesystem drivers currently known to the kernel into 'buffer'. Each name is 16 bytes long and is NUL-terminated. This means that after a successful call, every 16th character will be a valid C string naming a driver. 'maxcount' is the maximum number of names to store in the 'buffer'.

>RETURN VALUE

On success, this function returns a positive number - the amount of driver names stored in the 'buffer'. On error it returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following:

\* *EFAULT* - 'buffer' is not a valid pointer.
