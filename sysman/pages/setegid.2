>SYNOPSIS

>RETURN VALUE

This function returns '0' on success, or '-1' on error and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following:

\* *EPERM* - the current effective group ID is nonzero, and 'gid' is not the current effective, saved, or real group ID of the calling process.
