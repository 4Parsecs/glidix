random - the random stream

>SYNOPSIS

	/dev/random
	/dev/urandom

>DESCRIPTION

The special files '/dev/random' and '/dev/urandom' are streams of random data. When reading from either of those files, the buffer is filled with unpredictable data generated by a chaotic algorithm. The '/dev/urandom' file is guaranteed to never block; '/dev/random' may block.
