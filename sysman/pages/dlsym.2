dlsym - get library symbol

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <dlfcn.h>
	
	void* dlsym(void *'handle', const char *'name');
	
	/* Link with '-ldl' */

>DESCRIPTION

This function searched for a symbol with the given 'name', beginning with the library indicated by 'handle', previously returned by [dlopen.2]. The library itself is searched for the symbol first. If the library was loaded with the *RTLD_GLOBAL* flag, then all libraries loaded after it, including its dependencies, are searched too. If the handle refers to the main executable, as returned by [dlopen.2] with the 'soname' specified as *NULL*, then all symbols available for resolution in the current process image (including in libraries loaded with *RTLD_GLOBAL*) are searched.

>RETURN VALUE

On success (the symbol was found), the value of that symbol is returned (for example, the pointer to the function 'name', or a pointer to global variable 'name'). On error, *NULL* is returned; an error message may be obtained with [dlerror.2].

>ERRORS

Errors from this function are reported by [dlerror.2].
