>NAME

sniff - Capture packets on a network interface

>SYNOPSIS

	sniff -i 'interface' [-o 'output-file'] [-p 'protocol']

>DESCRIPTION

This command is used to capture packets being sent/received on the network interface 'interface'. The packets are written to the 'output-file' as a hexdump, with each line being made from the offset into the packet, then 16 bytes of the pacekt in hex, followed by the ASCII dump. If no output file is specified, it defaults to 'interface'*.cap*. An example packet dump may look as follows (this one showing 2 different packets):

	000000 52 54 00 12 34 56 52 54 00 12 34 55 08 00 45 00  RT..4VRT..4U..E.

The 'protocol' option is used to specify what types of packets should be captured. The default is *ip*. The full set of options is:

\* *ip* - captures IPv4/IPv6 packets, with no additional headers.
\* *ether* - captures Ethernet frames (including the Ethernet headers). Only works on Ethernet interfaces. This can, therefore, capture protocols other than IPv4 and IPv6, such as ARP.

Only the 'root' user is allowed to run this command.

>EXAMPLES

Capture IP packets on the 'eth0' interface, and write the results to 'eth0.cap':

	sniff -i eth0

Capture IP packets on the 'eth0' interface, and write the results to 'ipdump':

	sniff -i eth0 -o ipdump

Capture whole Ethernet frames on the 'eth0' interface, and write the results to 'etherdump':

	sniff -i eth0 -o etherdump -p ether
