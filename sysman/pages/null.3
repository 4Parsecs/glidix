>NAME

null - the null file

>SYNOPSIS

	/dev/null

>DESCRIPTION

The special file '/dev/null' may be opened in read/write mode by any user, and has the following special properties:

\* Reading this file always returns EOF. See [read.2].

\* Writing to this file causes the write to be reported as successful, but the data is simply discarded. See [write.2].

\* It may be successfully mapped into memory, but any attempt to access its pages results in the reception of the *SIGBUS* signal. See [mmap.2] and [signal.6].
