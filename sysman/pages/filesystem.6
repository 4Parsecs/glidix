>NAME

filesystem - the filesystem under Glidix

>DESCRIPTION

Glidix organizes all files, directories, etc (henceforth referred to as 'inodes') into a hierarchy known as the 'virtual file system' or VFS. The root of this tree is known as the 'root directory', named '/' (slash) by the system. Each branch is known as a 'directory', and each leaf is a 'file', 'symbolic link', or a special type of inode (see below).

>>Absolute and Relative Paths

Each thread has what is known as a 'current working directory'; this is a position within the file system that is used as a strating point for 'relative path resolution'. A 'relative path' is one which does not start with the '/' character. An 'absolute path' begins with the '/' character; and its resolution begins at the root directory.

For example, if the working directory is '/etc', then the path 'my_dir/my_file' refers to '/etc/my_dir/my_file'.

>>Mount Points

The VFS is constructed from multiple 'mounted' filesystems, whose root directories are placed at 'mount points' within the VFS. The main disk (where the system is installed) is mounted at '/'; and hence its root directory is also the root directory of the whole VFS. A CD may be mounted, for example, under '/media/cdrom'; and then the directory '/media/cdrom' becomes mapped to the CD\'s root directory. The [fsinfo.1] command can be used to list the mounted filesystems.

It is possible to mount a filesystem under a file instead of a directory; in this case, calling [stat.2] (or executing [stat.1]) on the file results in it being reported as a directory; this is helpful in using archives as directories.

There are also some special, pseudo-filesystems mounted automatically by the kernel upon boot-up, for various purposes:

\* A [ramfs.6] called '.tmp' is mounted under '/tmp' for temporary files; and another named '.run' under '/run' and '/var/run', for shared runtime information.

\* The [modfs.6] mounted under '/sys/mod', presenting loaded kernel modules (and allowing them to be removed).

\* The [initrd.6] mounted under '/initrd'.

\* The [procfs.6] mounted under '/proc', presenting information about running processes.

\* The [devfs.6] mounted under '/dev', giving access to various devices.

>>Types of Inodes

\* A 'directory' is an inode which lists other inodes; it is a branch in the hierarchy of the filesystem.
\* A 'regular file' contains arbitrary data and is random-access.
\* A 'symbolic link' contains the path to another inode, and most system calls "follow" this link when an operation is requested on it; the only 2 exceptions are lstat (see [stat.2]) and [unlink.2].
\* A 'FIFO' (first-in first-out) or 'named pipe' is used to connect together 2 processes. Not implemented in Glidix yet.
\* A 'character device' is a character from which it is possible to read/write bytes sequentially, but is not random-access.
\* A 'block device' is the same as a character device under Glidix.

Note that character and block devices are treated exactly the same as normal files in most circumstances, under Glidix; they are simply reported as different types to denote their intended purpose.
