errno - system error numbers

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <errno.h>

>DESCRIPTION

The '<errno.h>' header defines a macro called 'errno' which evaluates to an lvalue of type 'int'. It can thus be viewed as a normal integer variable, except that it is thread-local: setting its value in one thread does not change its value as seen by other threads. This variable is set by library functions and system calls when they report errors. It may also be changed by a successful function.

This header also defines macros representing error numbers (to which 'errno' may be set). All error numbers are nonzero and distinct from each other; except *EAGAIN* and *EWOULDBLOCK* - those have the same value under Glidix. On other operating systems, it is unspecified whether *EAGAIN* and *EWOULDBLOCK* have the same value; it may or may not be the case.
