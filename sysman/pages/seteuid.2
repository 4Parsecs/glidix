seteuid - set effective user ID

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	
	int seteuid(uid_t 'uid');

>DESCRIPTION

This function sets the effective user ID of the calling process to 'uid'. If the current effective user ID is 0 ('root'), then it is possible to set the EUID to any value. Otherwise, 'uid' must match the current effective user ID, or the current saved-set-user ID, or the real user ID of the calling process.

>RETURN VALUE

This function returns '0' on success, or '-1' on error and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following values:

\* *EPERM* - the current effective user ID is nonzero and 'uid' is not the current effective, saved, or real user ID of the calling process.
