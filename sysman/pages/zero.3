>NAME

zero - the zero stream

>SYNOPSIS

	/dev/zero

>DESCRIPTION

The special file '/dev/zero' may be opened in read/write mode by any user, and has the following special properties:

\* Reading this file always results in the buffer being filled with all zeroes, and it may be read from indefinetely. See [read.2].

\* Writing to this file results in the write being reported as successful, but the data is discarded. See [write.2].

\* Mapping this file into memory is equivalent to establishing an anonymous mapping - pages are initially zeroed, and are not committed to disk. See [mmap.2].
