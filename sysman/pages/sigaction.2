sigaction - get or set a signal disposition

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <signal.h>
	
	int sigaction(int 'signum', const struct sigaction *'act', struct sigaction *'oldact');

>DESCRIPTION

This function gets or sets the signal dispoition for the signal 'signum'. It is impossible to set the signal disposition for *SIGKILL* and *SIGSTOP*; the setting for them is ignored and the default action is always taken. If 'oldact' is not *NULL*, then the current disposition is first placed in the structure located at 'oldact'. Then, if 'act' is not *NULL*, the disposition is changed according to the structure at 'act'. The 'struct sigaction' structure is defined in '<signal.h>' and includes at least the following fields:

	struct sigaction
	{
		void (*'sa_handler')(int);
		sigset_t 'sa_mask';
		int 'sa_flags';
		void (*'sa_sigaction')(int, siginfo_t*, void*);
	};

This structure should be zeroed out before filling out any fields. All zeroes means all defaults.

If *SA_SIGINFO* is *NOT* given in 'sa_flags', then 'sa_handler' defines the action to take when the signal arrives:

\* If 'sa_handler' is *SIG_DFL*, the default action is taken, as detailed in [signal.6].
\* If 'sa_handler' is *SIG_IGN*, the signal is ignored.
\* If 'sa_handler' is *SIG_CORE*, then a [core.6] file is produced, and the process is terminated. This macro is only available if *_GLIDIX_SOURCE* is defined before including 'any' header files.
\* Otherwise, 'sa_handler' must be a pointer to a function which is called upon receiving the signal. It takes the signal number as the only argument.

The 'sa_flags' field is a bitwise-OR of zero or more signal flags. Currently, the only flag respected by Glidix is *SA_SIGINFO*. If passed, the 'sa_handler' field is ignored, and instead, the 'sa_sigaction' field specifies a function to call when the signal arrives. The function takes as arguments the signal number, a 'siginfo_t' pointer describing the signal, and a 'ucontext_t' pointer (cast to 'void \*') referring to the state before catching the signal (this is usually ignored by the handler).

The 'sa_mask' field is the set of signals which should be blocked while the handler is running.

The 'siginfo_t' structure describes the signal, and is defiend in '<signal.h>' with at least the following fields:

	union sigval
	{
		int		'sival_int';
		void*		'sival_ptr';
	};
	
	typedef struct
	{
		int		'si_signo';
		int		'si_code';
		int		'si_errno';
		pid_t		'si_pid';
		uid_t		'si_uid';
		void*		'si_addr';
		int		'si_status';
		long		'si_band';
		union sigval	'si_value';
	} siginfo_t;

The 'si_siginfo' field contains the signal number which was delivered, and 'si_code' specifies the reason for the signal's delivery. Some of those values are independent of the signal, while others are signal-specific:

\* *SI_USER* - signal sent with [kill.2].
\* *SI_QUEUE* - signal sent by [sigqueue.2].
\* *SI_TIMER* - signal sent by expiration of a timer.
\* *SI_ASYNCIO* - signal sent due to completion of an asynchronous I/O request.
\* *SI_MESGQ* - signal sent due to the reception of a message on an empty message queue.

For the *SIGILL* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *ILL_ILLOPC* - illegal opcode.
\* *ILL_ILLOPN* - illegal operand.
\* *ILL_ILLADR* - illegal addressing mode.
\* *ILL_ILLTRP* - illegal trap.
\* *ILL_PRVOPC* - privileged opcode.
\* *ILL_PRVREG* - privileged register.
\* *ILL_COPROC* - coprocessor error.
\* *ILL_BADSTK* - stack broken.

For the *SIGFPE* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *FPE_INTDIV* - integer division by zero.
\* *FPE_INTOVF* - integer overflow.
\* *FPE_FLTDIV* - floating-point division by zero.
\* *FPE_FLTOVF* - floating-point overflow.
\* *FPE_FLTUND* - floating-point underflow.
\* *FPE_FLTRES* - inexact floating-point result.
\* *FPE_FLTINV* - invalid floating-point operation.
\* *FPE_FLTSUB* - subscript out of range.

For the *SIGSEGV* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *SEGV_MAPERR* - no mapping exists at the requested address.
\* *SEGV_ACCERR* - an object is mapped to the requested address, but the requested operation on it is not permitted.

For the *SIGBUS* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *BUS_ADRALN* - unaligned address.
\* *BUS_ADRERR* - nonexistent physical address.
\* *BUS_OBJERR* - object-specific hardware error.

For the *SIGTRAP* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *TRAP_BRKPT* - breakpoint encountered.
\* *TRAP_TRACE* - trace trap encountered.

For the *SIGCHLD* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *CLD_EXITED* - child process has exited.
\* *CLD_KILLED* - process terminated abnormally (by a signal), without making a [core.6] file.
\* *CLD_DUMPED* - process terminated abnormally (by a signal) and produced a [core.6] file.
\* *CLD_TRAPPED* - child has encountered a trap.
\* *CLD_STOPPED* - child has stopped.
\* *CLD_CONTINUED* - child has continued.

For the *SIGPOLL* signal, 'si_code' may also contain:

\* *POLL_IN* - data input available.
\* *POLL_OUT* - output buffers available.
\* *POLL_MSG* - input message available.
\* *POLL_ERR* - I/O error.
\* *POLL_PRI* - high-priority input available.
\* *POLL_HUP* - device disconnected.

The 'si_errno' field is always zero (on some implementations it may contain an error number associated with the signal; see [errno.6]).

The 'si_pid' field contains the process ID of the process which sent the signal, the child process ID for *SIGCHLD*, and zero if not applicable.

The 'si_uid' field contains the real user ID of the sending process (the child, if the signal is *SIGCHLD*), or zero ('root') if not applicable. See [creds.6].

The 'si_addr' field contains the address of the illegal instruction for the *SIGILL* sginal, the address used for the invalid memory reference for the *SIGSEGV* signal, *NULL* otherwise.

The 'si_status' field contains the exit status, or the signal causing the termination, for the *SIGCHLD* signal; zero otherwise.

The 'si_band' field contains the band event for *SIGPOLL*. This is unused under Glidix and will be zero.

The 'si_value' field is a union, such that it is interpreted either as an integer ('sival_int') or a pointer ('sival_ptr'). It may be specified by [sigqueue.2], otherwise it is zero (or *NULL*).

>RETURN VALUE

On success, this function returns '0'. On error, it returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On failure, this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following:

\* *EFAULT* - one of the pointers ('act' or 'oldact') points outside the accessible address space. It is unspecified whether the disposition has been changed.
\* *EINVAL* - 'signum' was invalid, or it was *SIGKILL* or *SIGSTOP*, for which the disposition cannot be set.

>SAFETY

When a signal handler is called, it may have interrupted any state. This means that, for example, attempting to lock a mutex could resolve in a deadlock, if the interrupted thread already holds it. This means that signal handlers are limited, and special care should be taken when writing code for them:

\* Any global variables which are accessed must be 'volatile', and the only type that is guaranteed to be safely settable is 'sig_atomic_t', an integer type defined in '<signal.h>'.
\* Only async-signal-safe functions can be called; these are reentrant functions do not use any locks, are fully atomic and will work no matter at which point they are interrupted. All system calls are async-signal-safe (as kernel mode cannot be interrupted), and so are some library functions (only if explicitly marked as such). All other functions may not be called.

The typical behavior of a signal handler is to simply set some global variable and return; the interrupted code should be able to notice the change (by checking for it) and respond appropriately.
