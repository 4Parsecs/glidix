mkinitrd - create initial ramdisk image

>SYNOPSIS

	mkinitrd [--no-default-initmod] [--kernel='kernel'] [--output='output'] [--init='init'] ['initmod']...

>DESCRIPTION

This command is used to create an initial ramdisk image, which may be loaded by a bootloader into memory while booting Glidix, and then be mounted at '/initrd' upon startup; see [initrd.6].

By default, when 'mkinitrd' is ran without arguments, it creates the initrd image at the default location, '/boot/vmglidix.tar', and takes files from the currently-mounted initrd. This means that it should not change anything. When given command-line arguments, it\'s behavior changes, as follows:

\* *--no-default-initmod* - by default, 'mkinitrd' will add to the initrd all modules currently located under '/initrd/initmod', as well as modules named at the command-line. When this option is passed, the default modules are not included, and only modules from the command-line are taken.

\* *--kernel=*'kernel' - specifies a kernel image to place on the initrd. By default, it is the current kernel ('/initrd/kernel.so'). The kernel placed in the initrd will be loaded by the bootloader.

\* *--output=*'output' - specified the output file, into which the initrd image will be written. By default, it is '/boot/vmglidix.tar'.

\* *--init=*'init' - specifies the path to the [init.6] executable to place on the initrd. By default, it is the current init daemon ('/initrd/init'). This is the first executable that will be loaded by the kernel upon bootup, and is responsible for starting up the rest of the system. See [init.6] for more information.

\* 'initmod' - command-line arguments which do not start with a hyphen (*-*) are treated as modules which shall be placed under '/initrd/initmod' in the image being created.
