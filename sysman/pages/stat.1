>SYNOPSIS

	stat [-f] 'path'

>DESCRIPTION

	Device:     8
	Inode:      121
	Mode:       644
	Links:      1
	Owner:      1000 <some-user>
	Group:      1000 <some-user>
	Type:       Regular file
	Size:       0 B
	A-time:     Sun Jun19 20:52:36 2016
	M-time:     Sun Jun19 20:52:36 2016
	C-time:     Sun Jun19 20:52:36 2016
	Block size: 512 B
	Blocks:     0
	I. Perms:   000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
	O. Perms:   000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The *Device* field identifies which device the file is located on; *Inode* is a unique ID within that filesystem. *Mode* is the file access mode (permissions) of the file; see [access_mode.6]. *Links* is the sum of the number of hard links pointing to the inode, and the open file descriptions referring to it. *Owner* and *Group* specify the owner of the file, and the associated group, respectively. *Type* identifies the type of inode (directory, file, etc.). If it is a symbolic link, there is also a *Target* field which specifies where the link leads to. *Size* gives the size of the file. *A-time*, *M-time* and *C-time* are the last access time, the last modification time, and the time of last attribute change, respectively. *Block size* specifies, in bytes, the size of a data unit on the filesystem containing this file, and *Blocks* specifies the number of blocks occupied by the file. The *I. Perms*, *O. Perms* and *D. Perms* fields specify the inheritable, own and delegatable permissions of the file, respectively, if it is executable; see [xperm.6].
