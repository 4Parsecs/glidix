>NAME

free - free a block of dynamically allocated memory

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <stdlib.h>
	
	void free(void *'block');

>DESCRIPTION

This function returns the block identified by 'block' to the heap, such that it may be reused by later calls to [malloc.2] or related functions. The 'block' must either be *NULL* (in which case nothing happens), or a pointer previously returned by [malloc.2] or related functions. Attempting to free an invalid pointer results in undefined behavior. Furthermore, accessing 'block' after it has been freed results in undefined behavior too.

>RETURN VALUE

This function does not return anything.

>ERRORS

This function does not return errors, but it may abort if it detects heap corruption, or an attempt to free an invalid pointer.

>SEE ALSO
