>NAME

if_nameindex - get a list of network interfaces

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <net/if.h>
	
	struct if_nameindex* if_nameindex();

>DESCRIPTION

This function returns an array of network interfaces, described by 'struct if_nameindex', which has at least the following fields:

	struct if_nameindex
	{
		unsigned int				'if_index';
		char*					'if_name';
	};

The list is terminated by an entry with 'if_index' set to 0, and 'if_name' set to *NULL*. For all other entries, 'if_index' contains the interface index, and 'if_name' contains its name. The returned list must later be freed using [if_freenameindex.2].

>RETURN VALUE

This function returns a pointer to the interface array on success. On error, it returns *NULL* and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns *NULL* and sets [errno.6] appropriately. Under Glidix, this currently never happens, but it is recommended to check the return value for portability.
