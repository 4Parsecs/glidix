>NAME

setreuid - set real and effective user ID

>SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	
	int setreuid(uid_t 'ruid', uid_t 'euid');

>DESCRIPTION

This function changes the real and effective user IDs of the calling process to 'ruid' and 'euid', respectively. Either of those values may be '-1', indicating that their respective value should not change (for example, if 'ruid' is '-1' then the real user ID is not updated).

If 'ruid' is not '-1', then the effective user ID must be 0 ('root'), otherwise the *EPERM* error is raised.

If 'euid' is not '-1', and the effective user ID is not 0 ('root'), then 'euid' must match the current effective or real user ID of the calling process. In either case, if 'euid' is different from the current real user ID, the saved user ID is set to 'euid'.

>RETURN VALUE

This function returns '0' on success, or '-1' on error, and sets [errno.6] appropriately.

>ERRORS

On error, this function returns '-1' and sets [errno.6] to one of the following values:

\* *EPERM* - 'ruid' is not '-1' and the effective user ID is nonzero; or 'euid' is not '-1' and the current effective user ID is nonzero and 'euid' does not match the current effective or real user ID.
